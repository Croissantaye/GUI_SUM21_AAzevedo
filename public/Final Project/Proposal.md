My project is going to be a fly over simulation. The user will be able to move above the terrain on a parallel plane. The user will be able to look around 360 degrees with their mouse. The terrain will consist of raised like mountains and hills and lowered areas like valleys and lakes. The different land types (mountains, valleys, etc) will blend between different textures.


week 1
research THREE.js to learn syntax and other applicable frameworks for shaders

week 2
figure out how to use random noise to generate a terrain with valleys, hills, mountains, water, etc
Find a way to have the terrain be inifinte using something like a chunk loading or using time when doing noise generation

week 3
set up camera controls to be able to move the camera around using WASD with a basic forward, backward, left and right
set up mouse controls to rotate the camera

week 4 
setup procedural texture generation based off hieght of vertex
add water texture

week 5
Bug fixing and any other work that needs to still be done
